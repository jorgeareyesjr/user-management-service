# User Service for Personalized Online Learning Platform
This Node.js service is designed to manage user accounts, authentication, and profiles for a personalized online learning platform. It is built with MongoDB for data storage and scalability.

## Features
- User account creation
- User authentication and authorization
- User profile management
- Secure password storage
- Token-based authentication

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT for authentication

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:
- **src**: Contains source code files
    - **controllers**: Logic for handling user operations
    - **models**: MongoDB schema definitions
    - **routes**: API routes for User Service
    - **middlewares**: Middleware functions for authentication, error handling, etc.
    - **services**: Additional business logic or service integrations
- **config**: Configuration files for the Node.js application
- **test**: Unit tests for the User Service
- **utils**: Utility functions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up a MongoDB database
4. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file
5. Run the server with `npm start`

## Environment Configuration
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
- Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=ExampleValue:mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
    MONGO_DB=ExampleValue:myMongoDBName
    MONGO_USERS_COLLECTION=ExampleValue:users
    MONGO_SESSIONS_COLLECTION=ExampleValue:sessions
    JWT_SECRET=ExampleValue:jwt-secret-key
    JWT_EXPIRATION=ExampleValue:7d
    PORT=ExampleValue:3000
    ```
- Save the `.env` file with your desired configuration settings.

Make sure to include the `.env` file in your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in your version control system. You can then load and use these environment variables in your Node.js application to manage configuration settings securely.

## Usage
- Register a new user: `POST /api/users/register`
- Login and receive authentication token: `POST /api/users/login`
- Get user profile: `GET /api/users/profile`

## Testing
- Run unit tests with `npm test`
